# CNN model used for flood modeling

this is the CNN model implementation for the paper [data-driven rapid flood prediction mapping with catchment generalizability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169422003018)

the data used for this research has been released via ETH research collection: [Flood simulation data for ...](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/453305)

the code has not been properly cleaned and it is quite messy. I provided [an example](src/example.ipynb) that shows how to build the CNN model with a configuration file.
